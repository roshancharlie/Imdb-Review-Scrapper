1,27 November 2022,frankiesilver-91836,6," A very bold but fairly underwhelming, slow, and bloated Marvel project.
","I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on. When they confirmed he wouldn't be recast, I felt like it was a big mistake narratively.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Phase 4's MCU comes to a close with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have.

11,11 November 2022,cthirlby,8," Empty
","Obviously this movie is a huge thing. Chadwick is a legend and will always be seen as the black panther. This movie was just so filler and boring with a pace that's way too slow for a 2 hour+ film. It's not a bad film it's just a long slog of a movie. Nothing big happens in the movie at all apart from the mantle passing of black panther, it's very empty. Compared to the first black panther it's a completely different tone and pace to it which wouldn't be a bad thing if the story was engaging. Shuri becoming the new black panther I expected due to comic knowledge and I'm happy with that and I thought her story was decent along with showing her dark side especially in her fight with Namor. All the performances were great and I liked Riri Williams as an addition to the MCU, whilst some of her scenes were stale and the suit looked like trash I'll stay open minded for her show. Namor was okay, he was cool to watch. Namor and his people let the story down as it was built up to be this huge war but ultimately led to nothing but boring and ugly fight scenes between everyone and this was in the whole movie too! Namor was interesting just a poorly written character mostly which was unfortunate. The post credit scenes were underwhelming and they did a fast and furious by naming a child after the character/person that died which was fine I guess but unnecessary. The comedy was great though even though it lacked which is what made it rewarding when it happened. The scenes honouring Chadwick were fantastic though leaving me to tear up with how connected I was along with the world to this person and character. Those scenes were special. Also the film ended the same as it started with empty threats of war between the two groups leaving no hype for the future and the overwhelming feeling of being unrewarding. Overall Black Panther Wakanda Forever pays a beautiful and emotional tribute to Chadwick but lacks heavily in a well written or engaging story.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

14,5 December 2022,Darwinskid,," Frustrating.
","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has ambitious goals but does not manage to meet them due to its overlong and sometimes unfocused screenplay that often feels very first draft level in craft and trying to have one too many political conversations to streamline linearly. It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments. Still, you feel that the character probably should have come into the picture a lot earlier on, like in Phase Two or Phase Three at the least.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success.

17,27 November 2022,fredschaefer-406-623204,6," Chadwick Boseman is sorely missed.
","If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

27,12 November 2022,brentsbulletinboard,9," A Fitting Tribute
","At the risk of overstatement, it's hard not to be blown away by writer-director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has. Wakanda Forever indeed.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv
28,20 November 2022,kgprophet,6," Should Have Been a Series
","There is a huge amount story to tell in this very large scope world of Wakanda. Lots of characters with lots of goals to obtain. All the major characters are quite emotionally driven I must say. With so much to accomplish, the audience has a lot to digest in one long sitting. This type of ensemble setting with kingdoms and leaders and betrayals works better as a ""Game of Thrones"" type of series. It would also give the audience more time to appreciate the production design and costumes. The appealing look of the film helped to give the character performances more impact. The story rightly avoids being about the missing main character, the now deceased Black Panther.

Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan (sorry if misspelled) was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy.

38,11 November 2022,goshamorrell,10," A tribute
","The center of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever""-the sequel to the hugely popular ""Black Panther,"" and a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman-is sincere, even if the overall film feels manufactured. It begins with a funeral for the recently deceased King T'Challa. Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are dressed in white, following the black coffin, whose top features a silver emblem of the Black Panther mask and the crossed arms of the Wakanda salute. Their mournful procession, winding through the kingdom, is contrasted with slow-motion tracking shots of dancers jubilantly dancing in memory of their fallen king. After the coffin arrives at a clearing, where it ceremoniously rises to the sky, we cut to an earnest, emotional montage of Boseman as T'Challa. The solemn, aching continuum of images soon forms the ""Marvel Studios"" logo, announcing that this is still a Marvel movie. And ""Wakanda Forever"" is all the worst for it. But writer/director Ryan Coogler and his co-writer Joe Robert Cole don't possess the same kind of freedom with this melancholy sequel. Some limitations aren't within their control, such as the tragic death of Boseman. The hulking script is chock-full of ideas and themes. Rather than fighting their common enemy (white colonists), two kingdoms helmed by people of color are pitted against each other (an idea that never thematically lands), and the film must delve into the cultural pain that still exists from the historical annihilation of Central and South America's Indigenous kingdoms. A major sea battle ensues, new, ropey gadgets are employed, and loose ends are inarticulately tied. Another montage dedicated to Boseman occurs, and while the film is messy, you're relieved that it begins and ends on the right foot. That is, until the saccharine post-credit scene. I'm not sure what Coogler was thinking. He had more weight on him for this movie than any filmmaker deserves. But when this scene occurred, I audibly groaned at what amounts to a weepy, treacly moment that's wholly unnecessary, emotionally manipulative, and partially unearned. It's one of the many instances where ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" might have its heart in the right place but is in the wrong mindset and in the worst space-at the center of a contrived cinematic universe-to mourn on its own terms.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie and I don't want to sour anyone's opinion in watching it. But like with almodt everything in phase 4, temper, temper, temper your expectations. The movie at times can pay beautiful homages to Chadwick Boseman, and then in other times it builds you up and as a viewer and lover of the Marvel films, you feel like it would be a perfect time for another touching moment to reflect on Boseman's legacy, and it will totally drop the ball. And then on top of all that, the story for this feel has to be one of the weakest (except for Thor: Love & Thunder). I feel like Marvel studios thinks that if they put in enough jokes and enough comic references that we will look over lazy writing. But they are wrong! And I am deeply upset that showed that in this film most of all. Letitia Wright was amazing as ever in this film and carried it a lot. But there is only so much she can do.

","I liked the creativity of the narrative, certainly original and refreshing, but there was still too much cheesy dialogue and scenes that took away from the story. Plus both the hero and anti-hero were not convincing whatsoever in their roles. Tenoch Huerta's acting felt like it was his first ever acting role. And pretty much every attempt at humor was a miss, and ended up being cheesy and lame, some even feeling like Fendi subliminal advertising more than anything else. Even with the fairly decent pacing, the 161 min runtime felt much longer with many bloated and unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it more than the first film, and it's a fairly decent one-time watch.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a weak overlong boring slow-paced of a movie, it's NOT A BAD FILM, it's more of like a super mediocre average movie that are going super slow and nothing really exciting happening, it is mostly feels empty, the movie still has it's moments and performances, i think all the performance was great, i like some of the visual and sound, but compare to the first Black Panther not only at first the 2018 Black Panther movie feels like a celebration, this one is a grieving, so much things that are just less than the first one, the music is not as good, the fight scene is not as good, and the visual is not as good, so what do i like again about the movie, Namor i think was a pretty good villain, not the best villain ever but he was still pretty good, all the fight scene was pretty good (except the final battle i can count about only 3 or 4 fight scene for 2 hours and 41 minutes movie and yes that's another flop for me, it's too few for a movie this long), final battle was ok again not making me excited or anything, Riri Williams was alright too, i still expected more from her, and the new Black Panther suit was sweet!, not really buying the blue people, so overall i didn't hate Black Panther: Wakanda Forever like i hate Thor: Love And Thunder, and i didn't leave the theater pissed about it like i did with Thor: Love And Thunder, it is another miss twice in a row for an MCU film, a super flawed movie that feels empty, feels long, and feels bored for the most part, still has it's moments and pros in it, not a bad movie, but definitely a disappointment and still a miss.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","2018's Black Panther remains one of my favorite MCU entries despite some script and CGI shortcomings. The sudden passing of the tremendously talented and regal Chadwick Boseman was a celebrity death that hit me hard. As a lifelong Marvel fan since childhood, it was so exciting to see such perfect casting for a comic character who had the potential to become such a huge force of culture like Spider-Man or Batman. How does a franchise recover from the undeserved and untimely passing of a core cast member? We've seen this before with legends like Bruce&Brandon Lee, and the incredible Heath Ledger.

63,13 November 2022,Ireviewstuff_exe,7," A beautiful and ambitious epic
","Black Panther Wakanda Forever is a fitting and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman. You can tell that they purposely dialled down the usual MCU humour to give this movie the somber tone it needed. The memorial scenes at the beginning and ending of the movie are handled very well. They are respectful of his legacy and poignant. And although the beating heart of the first movie in Boseman isn't there, Letitia Wright still manages to pull off a rousing and impressive performance, stepping into Chadwick's shoes and taking up the mantle of The Black Panther. Another superb performance inside of this movie is Angela Basset as Queen Ramonda. With her scenes at the UN and the throne room being highlights. Tenoch Huerta is also very good as Namor. Who although is different from the comics is very interesting as a character. Another bright spot in the movie is the visuals. Coogler really nailed it here. There are many simply breathtaking shots especially in the underwater scenes and Wakandan scenes. Another strength is the side characters. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne is fun when on screen and it made me more excited for her Disney + show. As always, Winston Duke's M'Baku was very cool. And Martin Freeman returns again as Everett Ross and although he has a minor part to play in the movie's story, he is still enjoyable. Despite all these positives the movie definitely isn't perfect. It is overlong and perhaps too light on action (although when there is action it is done very well), the movie sometimes feels too slow-paced and it potentially could have devoted more of it's runtime to paying respect to Chadwick Boseman. Another odd thing I noticed was the designs of some of the characters and costumes. Some of them feel slightly derivative at times. Especially Namor's people, who look a lot like the people from Avatar. Which was especially funny since the cinema I watched it at played trailers for Way of the Water before the movie started. Another odd thing that I noticed was Ironheart's suit. It looks more like the Red Power Ranger suit or Samus's suit then a Iron Man style suit, with that being said though, it was nice to see some Iron Man style action again.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","The death of lead actor Chadwick Boseman from cancer was sad and shocking, and a big blow to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, many questioned if his character would be recast for the sequel, but director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Black Panther) went ahead with a story that incorporates this tragic loss. Basically, Shuri (Letitia Wright) is rushing to save the life of her brother, T'Challa, king of Wakanda, who is dying from an illness. She believes he can be cured by the ""heart-shaped herb"" and uses her technology to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by their cousin N'Jadaka aka Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But it is too late, T'Challa dies and all Wakanda come together for the funeral of their king, the Black Panther. One year later, a ship containing amounts of Vibranium are stolen. Wakanda is under pressure from nations of the world to gain access to the precious metal. After returning from a meeting at the United Nations, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) implores Shuri to continue her research on the heart-shaped herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda. But grief-stricken Shuri refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA, and US Navy SEALs use a machine that can detect Vibranium to locate a potential source underwater. The expedition is attacked and all aboard are killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing superhumans from Talokan, led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta). The CIA believe Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security, and blames them for the Vibranium race. He gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium-detecting machine, or Wakanda will be attacked. Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira), general of the Dora Milaje, learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne). Arriving at the university to confront Riri about her invention, the group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors. In their battle, Okoye is defeated, and Shuri and Williams are taken underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), who has been living in Haiti since the attack on Wakanda by Thanos. Namor shows Shuri the underwater kingdom of Talokan, which is rich with Vibranium, and has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor is bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya civilization, he proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world, threatening to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Riri escape, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda dies from drowning saving Riri. Namor vows to return with his full army, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans. Following the funeral of Ramonda, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. Confirming a high percentage of success, she swallows the synthetic herb containing her brother's DNA, and gains superhuman abilities. She meets N'Jadaka in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku (Winston Duke) urging for peace, Shuri wants vengeance on Namor for her mother's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo (Florence Kasumba) assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armour upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Chewing Gum's Michaela Coel) to join her. Riri joins the fight and aids the Wakandans in an Iron Man inspired high-powered mechanical exoskeleton suit. Namor and his warriors are lured by the Wakandans to the surface onto a seafaring vessel where a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash onto a desert beach and fight, with Shuri gaining the upper hand as Namor weakens from drying out. But Shuri realises the similarities between their paths and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora (Mabel Cadena), is upset at Namor surrendering, but he assures her that the new alliance will one day allow them to conquer the surface world. Riri returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. While Shuri is away, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral ceremonial robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve T'Challa. In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that T'Challa has a son, Toussaint (Divine Love Konadu-Sun); his mother Nakia has been raising him in secret, and his Wakandan name is T'Challa. Also starring Isaach De Bankolé as River Tribe Elder, Danny Sapani as Border Tribe Elder, Dorothy Steel as Merchant Tribe Elder, Trevor Noah as Griot, Zola Williams as Zola, Richard Schiff as US Secretary of State, and Anderson Cooper as himself. Wright as the new lead is fantastic as the brainy and brave sister character, Bassett and Gurira are great support as the nation leaders, Thorne is good as the young scientist, Freeman is fine in his little screen time, and Huerta does well as the villain. From the opening Marvel logo to the story itself, this serves as a tribute to Boseman, with a melancholic emotional feeling almost all throughout, but it also works well as a female-driven story, with some marvellous special effects and spectacular fights, it is a terrific superhero fantasy action. Very good!",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

But Wakanda Forever was always going to deliver significant change with a new Black Panther.

107,2 December 2022,theredsky,8," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review
","Phase 4 of the MCU really isn't that great in my opinion bar Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home but the writing for both of those is very weak at points. Wakanda Forever however stands way above the rest of Phase 4 and I'm really happy that Phase 4 ended this way. This film is an improvement over the first film in my opinion in almost every aspect. The visual effects while still off look better than the PS2 effects of the first movie. The characters here are all very well written and incredibly well acted. Angela Bassett gives probably one of the best performances in the entire series here and Letitia Wright does an amazing job as well. Wright probably has one of the best character arcs in the MCU as well. Watching her learn to process her grief over the death of her brother is heartbreaking. Her arc feels a lot more personal as does most of the rest of this film. To address the obvious, Chadwick Boseman's presence here is sorely missed but the film does an absolutly beautiful job at handling this. The film not really respects the character of T'Challa but also Chadwick as well. The first 10 minutes and last 5 address his departure and those last 5 minutes caused me to start crying. Tenoch Huerta does a great job as well and plays a great antagonist here although I do prefer Killmonger. Namor has an understandable motivation of protecting his people from being found on although he goes about it through the wrong way of attacking Wakanda. I struggle to call Namor a villain nor an anti-hero because of his motivation and his intentions to try and make peace at first. Ryan Coogler once again proves that he is easily one of the best directors in the MCU and the film just looks absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking films in the MCU and one of the best sounding. Ludwig Göransson's score is once again great although the music from the first film is just a little bit better. I did have some minor issues with the film though. I already mentioned the visual effects but the pacing here is definitely off. The first act (minus the first 10 minutes) speeds through everything before finally slowing down and the humor when it is used only works about 50% of the time although I do really like that this film MAJORLY cuts back on the typical MCU comedy. This is very easily one of the best entries in the MCU and I would definitely recommend watching this when you get the chance.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a very entertaining and emotionally satisfactory watch, serving as a highlight to Phase 4. Most important to the film's success is its dignified remembrance of Chadwick Boseman and his wonderful portrayal as the Black Panther. Beyond a fantastically emotional first act setup, though, the film is undeniably full of intriguing characters and events. Almost every character holds the audience's undivided attention, especially those of Ramonda and Shuri. As the respective mother and sister of the Black Panther, each character's dialogue is excellently written. This is taken to another level with the great performances by Bassett and Wright. Supporting Wakandan characters such as Okoye, Nakia, and M'Baku are additionally compelling and blessed with genuine portrayals by their respective cast members. Huerta's Namor adds another respectable villain to the MCU, as well. His motivations, while simple, are entirely justified. What makes this antagonist so intriguing, though, is the means by which he and his people achieve their goals. This ultimately leads to a third act, and resolution, that feels epic and earned. Wakanda Forever absolutely excels on a technical level, too. The sound is amazing, the score and soundtrack kick in at the exact right times, and a like to its predecessor, costume design is a near shoe in for an Oscar nomination. This all being said, the picture is not perfect. While technically proficient on the whole, some weak moments of CGI are certainly present and the editing has just as many shaky sequences. This is mostly attributable during the action that, while atmospheric, would have been more enjoyable with less cuts. There is additionally one too many characters within, which leads to a somewhat dull introduction of the Ironheart character. The character likely just doesn't quite fit with the emotional tone the picture was going for, which ends up warping the character arc into feeling rushed. The overall screenplay is not flawless, either, between a few scripted-feeling moments and points of blatant exposition.

Couldnt even relate to it his reaction to the outside world seemed rather late as he waited so long to even make a attempt to wage war and get revenge which just doesn't make sense when you see how powerful he was at such an young age. And there was an absurdly large amount of female characters in the movie it was hardly any male representation in the story. I don't mind female characters especially Okoye and Nakia I love both.

Every iteration of his portrayal were consistent throughout the years... until the MCU's version came out. Much like DC's Ocean Master, he was a haughty self absorbed egoist with a high-nobility way of speech to go along with it. This MCU version is basically as introverted, boring, and quiet as possible. When he threatened to kill a person or destroy the world, he said it with the gusto of reading the dictionary.

The Atlanteans as a whole got nerfed to hell in this universe, much like the Black Order was in Infinity Wars. The Black Order in the comics were each world destroyers. Proxima Midnight's spear had the weight of a sun that she could lift and throw it at will. They slew armies of Thors like nothing in Battleworld. Yet Black Widow, a normal human, blocked her strikes without becoming a pile of fleshy goo during the Wakanda battle. The same kind of nerf was applied to the Atlanteans in this movie. Even average joe Atlanteans can lift 4 tons because they live in the crushing depths of the oceans. Atlantean warriors are 10 tonners, basically as strong as an elephant. Attuma is an established 60 tonner yet Okoye, yet another normal human, blocked his strikes in fights, without an Iron Woman suit. So I guess either Okoye can block the charge of 6 elephants as well, or Attuma got nerfed to hell in this movie. I'm not even going to touch on how Namor, a 200,000 tonner got beat by Shuri's version of BP. Even weakened, he's as strong as Attuma in the comics and should be able to slap Shuri silly with ease. If DC can portray their Atlanteans accurately, why can't Marvel? DC's average Atlanteans can run through walls and destroy boulders with a punch. Marvel's Atlanteans gets flung and beat by humans. On the Wakanda storyline side, it was ok. The strongest acting came from Angela Bassett. Once she was gone, the acting became Disney Kids shows level.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Before seeing Wakanda Forever, it seemed like an impossible task to match the success of the first Black Panther film from 2018....... how could anyone adequately fill Chadwick Boseman's shoes or ever revitalize and re-energize the Black Panther legend? Some viewers probably went into theaters this time with some skepticism but Ryan Coogler (director and co-writer) generated a small miracle going in different, unexpected directions. The acting Team including Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o all brought genuinely heartfelt performances containing extra dimensions of poignancy that took the audience to emotionally resonant realms rarely seen in Marvel films (or any big-budget action movies for that matter). I was really surprised by the intensity of authentic emotions throughout... each character was forced to overcome nearly insurmountable grief and adversity in order to step-up and transform thru shear perseverance to fulfil a unique personal journey.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman. It's not overly done, and I feel it's respectful enough, although I'm not entirely satisfied about the cause of the character's death. I agree the character of T'challa shouldnt be replaced, despite Boseman's brother insisting otherwise. There are things I like about the movie, like how Shuri doesnt take the mantle of Black Panther too early, and how she doesnt automatically become queen opon her mother's death. I also like that she is conflicted when she first took the herb. Many to like, but there are some things that I feel make this movie feel average. First, the heart shaped herb. Shuri only succeeded in making the synthetic herb after sampling the properties of the bracelet given by Namor because the fiber is made of ""vibranium rich plant."" If I'm not mistaken, Wakanda is pretty rich in vibranium itself. Second, the MCU has always had one big problem: the villains. Other than Thanos, Loki and Kilmonger, the villains in MCU are pretty weak. Namor is no exception. Third, Shuri led her people to a massacre because she wanted revenge, and the Wakandans still feel she's fit to be the Black Panther? She doesnt even feel guilty about it afterwards. At least make her face the repercussions of her actions and choices. And fourth, Riri Williams aka Ironheart. In the comics, she stole the iron man tech, which I dont like but at least makes sense. In the movie, she made the whole thing from scrap. How the hell did she have the knowledge, materials, and technology to create it from the ground up? I get she's portrayed as a genius but she has neither Stark tech nor the fund. Maybe I just dont like the character. Overall, I give it a 7 because it's a fitting tribute to Boseman and it's still much better than recent Marvel efforts like Thor Love and Thunder and especially the Disney+ series.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Very poignant. I loved that they didn't just chuck T'challa to the side and just move on with the storyline. I loved that the movie actually had a storyline instead of constant fighting which is something that marvel movies tend to have too much off and neglect fleshing out the story in favour of blowing things up. Loved the dialogue, witty but not overdone. Also unlike the other marvel movies I actually empathised with the villain. Yes he was a bit extreme but do you blame his fear especially considering the history of his people and when he noticed the rest of the world trying to get their paws in Wakanda's honey after T'challa and his dad went public with their nation . Obviously the movie has to have a villain but initially I was rooting for the guy. The chemistry between him and Shuri was palpable.

","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is of course the long-awaited sequel to the incredibly successful ""Black Panther"" film from 2018 that became one of the most socially relevant films of its year and also one of the big players during the then following awards season. I think it is safe to say that in both fields this movie here will not make equally huge waves as the previous one, but from my perspective this sequel here I'd say is maybe even the superior movie from the two. Many will disagree and as you can see from my rating I was also not blown away by it, but I enjoyed it and I was definitely nicely entertained. There were even parts when I considered giving the film an even higher rating and 4 stars out of 5 or 8 out of 10 I could also say is nothing that really happens extremely often for me. I'd still say a 60% approval is fitting and accurate now. Of course, you did not have to do without the characters for four years since 2018 as there were other Marvel films in-between where the characters were included. The director and also writer here is again Ryan Coogler of course. I see he has worked on quite a few Black-themed films for years now, so I'd be curious to see him also for once shoot a movie away from race-related issues. Just like his co-writer Joe Robert Cole has done in the past for example. He even made a very White film on one occasion and he is also a director himself, but with this film here, the directing was all up to Coogler and today we will mostly talk about this film. It is an extremely long movie, even for Marvel standards at over 160 minutes including credits. The biggest challenge they had was basically deal with the untimely death of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther from the first film. I liked what they did with that. The film was a decent tribute and while references to Boseman in the film in terms of the plot were frequent, it never felt forced or like fake tearjerker material. For me personally, the opening was the most touching aspect maybe, how they included the Marvel opening they always use as a tribute to Boseman only.

Unfortunately since the passing of Chadwick Boseman, the cinematic elephant in the room before the film's release was how're they going to handle his passing since a recasting of the role was going to be considered an affront to Boseman's memory so dealing w/his character's passing, a sudden ailment which his sister Letitia Wright's brilliant scientist can't solve proves an ample subplot for her to deal w/his death since Wakanda needs a Panther & the flowers which create the hero were destroyed by Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan, in the last entry putting us in a place where scientific might may not trump tradition. Adding to the drama is the world's attempts to usurp Wakanda's hold on vibranium, the appearance of the mutant Namor (masterfully now rooted in Aztec mythology) who fears land dwellers will come to his kingdom seeking the powerful ore & also ReRe Williams, Dominque Thorne, a young genius following in the footsteps of Tony Stark, who's constructed a vibranium detector which has been co-opted by the American government which puts her on a death list penned by Namor. All of this climaxes on a troop barge where the seemingly insurmountable ocean dwellers are spurred back from the remaining Wakandan forces (after a flooding decimates the nation) where a Black Panther stands tall once again to not only right some wrongs but keep the world in their respective corners.

","Just like with the first movie, there's a lot about Wakanda Forever that I really, really liked. There's some amazing worldbuilding and powerhouse performances here, the story is enthralling, and the antagonist is about as perfect as you can get in the way he was developed and the role he served. The score by Ludwig Goransson was once again on-point, the realisation of Talokan was fantastic, and every reverence to Chadwick Boseman was respectful and heartbreaking in equal measure. This is a movie that really cared about the legacy of its late star, and was aware of the love and admiration he had earned. But unfortunately, also like the first movie, there was a bunch about Wakanda Forever that I wasn't as much of a fun of. It was too long, filled with too much faff, it was so badly lit certain scenes were almost unwatchable, and they put their bets on the wrong leading actor going ahead. And yet I'm eager to see the effect this movie has on the wider MCU going forward. It did lay the groundwork for a lot of upcoming projects, even if it was to the film's overall detriment. And if you ignore all of that the core elements of the film are essential viewing for any Marvel fan. Wakanda Forever somehow managed to simultaneously be one of the MCU's highest peaks, as well as one of its lowest ditches. And for that I fall on an entertaining 7/10 that remains an improvement on the first film. Huerta and Bassett may be enough on their own to earn an 8 though.

The new villain is the first Hispanic character of the Marvel universe, Namor, played by Tenouch Huerta. The storyline was much similar to Aquaman and the search for Atlantis. In the name of comparison DC did a better job than Marvel. In regards to the new Black Panther, Letitia Wright is not the strongest actor to play a superhero.

A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war. The Princess and her general head to Massachusetts where they track down a college student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as ""Shuri"". The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly.

","I'm not some Marvel fanboy. In fact, I don't like to be a fan of anything. Therefore, I was honest when I reviewed Taika Waititi's sloppy, even disastrous, Thor: Love and Thunder. But Wakanda Forever is another success for Marvel Studios. Seeing this film was the best experience that I had in a theater in a long time. When the film came to an end, I thought that it's now my favorite film from Phase Four of the MCU. But, after thinking some more about this, I decided that Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness are on par with Wakanda Forever. Some people have claimed that Kevin Feige has been giving directors more creative freedom since Phase Four began. If this is indeed the case, I understand why the output of Phase Four was uneven when it comes to quality. Wakanda Forever has director Ryan Coogler's style all over it. First of all, there aren't many action scenes in the film because it seems to me that Coogler prefers to focus on character development. This doesn't become a problem in the film because the performances of the actors (especially of Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Michael B. Jordan, and Tenoch Huerta) are good, the cinematography is good (for a modern film), the direction is good, and the music is good. Therefore, the scenes of people talking aren't a snoozefest here. I cared about Shuri's struggle more than I cared about T'Challa's struggle in Black Panther (2018). It seems that Shuri intentionally puts on a suit that looks similar to N'Jadaka's suit from Black Panther because she wants to get revenge. I do like the first Black Panther film, which contains more action scenes, but I like Wakanda Forever more because it's directed better and because it's more polished. Perhaps the reasons why this is the case are because the film has a bigger budget ($250 million) and because production and filming took longer. Or the reason could have been because Feige was more involved in making Wakanda Forever as good as possible. I think that the filmmakers and the actors wanted to make a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who died in 2020, but they also didn't want the film to be a waterworks show. The country of Wakanda is a more believable place in Wakanda Forever than in Black Panther. Since Wakanda Forever is a Marvel Studios film, it might gross more than $1 billion by the end of its theatrical run. Its popularity also means that it has already gotten plenty of hate from the haters that hate its ""woke"" content and plenty of praise from the lovers that love the MCU. I'm neither a hater nor a lover of the MCU. I simply like it because it's a good film and because it's another fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

Coogler attempts to pay tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman, to make another story about giant ideas (faith, grief, colonialism), to make a superhero movie without the hero, to elevate a ton of new characters, and to advance the MCU along in the process. It is a lot. Maybe that is why it ended up 2 hours and 40 minutes long. The good news is I was genuinely both entertained and moved at points. The bad news is I also spent too much time either wishing we could move things along, rolling eyes at the over the top technology, or wondering if this was an Avatar crossover event. Basically, some things worked and some things didn't. It was better than the most recent MCU movies I think (and the highs are higher), which says something given everything it tried to do.

","We all know Marvel has lots of money to spend and considering this is a 2 1/2 hour film I was expecting a good show but I was a little disappointed. At the time of writing this, this film has a higher rating than black adam which I just cannot understand. Black adam was funny and entertaining. This film has no humor whatsoever which is a shame. So it loses points for that. For the money that was clearly spent on this film I was disappointed. The first half of the film is introducing us to army 1. We already know wakanda which is army 2. Both talk in alien languages throughout most of the film and it is hard to follow the story as a result. I feel it would have made more sense if this was played out on a completely foreign alien planet which I just pretended it was most of the film. A lot of gibberish and there is a bit of action but nothing as entertaining as black adam provided. Why does army 2 invade army 1? I don't know. Maybe this was mentioned in the gibberish that I could not understand through half the film but whatever the reason, it was just a fake reason over a fake element called.vibranium. Nothing I could really relate to. I should really give this film a lower score but there was a lot of good flying spaceships... Anyway the enemies leader called Fishman was just a complete joke, and not in a funny way. It's a flying fish man like spider man who has pigeon wings to make him fly. Like what? Check it out and you will see what I mean. He has pigeon wings to make him fly. It's hilariously stupid. So I cannot relate to why this film has such a high rating at the time of writing this review. I have liked wakanda films so far but this one was just a let down. Wakanda has been portrayed as pretty much invincible, in charge of vibranium and the most advanced technology on this planet so what could marvel do to enhance their story? Not much to be honest but this just felt like an embarrassment. So yes they create a new invading army that feels the need to invade wakanda for what reason, I still don't know. Half way through the film once the fighting actually starts I thought, ok this must be the reason for the high rating but after a 5 minute fight that leads to nothing much there is then a lot of gibberish talking again, a big outrage, a bit more talking, a bit more talking, followed by more talking. What happens to fish man? Who knows - the talking is more important at this point and fish man loses his screen time. We are now approaching the end of the film and there is still more drama, over what? Not really sure. If you are a fan of tv soap drama's this might be right up your alley but if you like action films avoid this travesty. There is 5 minutes of action at about the 90 minute mark of the film that fizzles out into nothing but drama. The wakanda council convenes to plot a plan. The final battle takes place resulting in a big water sports spectable. Nothing you would expect from a 21st century marvel fim. Maybe one of those low budget horror films where a bunch of tourists get attacked by a giant shark. You know the type of film I mean. Anyway that pretty much concludes the film and my less than impressed review. Clearly others have enjoyed this more than me. The ending actually gets worse than I have revealed in my review but I will not give away marvels glorious final twist too much. Lets's just say for a fake battle the ending was the most pathetic ending I have seen in a film in the past decade along the lines of peace is more important than war. I mean I agree with that message but this was meant to be an action film, not a lame drama.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","With the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, the story for this movie needed to find a way to pass on the torch and honour him and this story does all of that to a certain extent. The story for this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie we've seen so far. There's so much raw emotion in this movie that will make everybody say either I'm not crying, you're crying or someone's cutting onions in here. But for the most part that's only the first part of this movie. The story of this movie is split into three different parts and they try to connect them seamlessly but it doesn't always work. The only parts of this movie's story that connect seamlessly are the second and third parts. I will give the movie this they tried to connect the first part into the third part and it did work. But honestly, nothing could save the second part of this movie's story from not being the slowest part of this movie. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes long and honestly, it didn't need to be that long. There's a lot of filler in this movie that easily could've been removed and nothing would've been missed. But at the end of the day, this movie just didn't feel like an MCU movie. There weren't that many jokes being shoved down your throat constantly or some slapstick just because. This movie just felt like a movie honouring a man who was lost way too early. This all can be traced back to one man who's Ryan Coogler, the writer and director. Ryan Coogler understood that once Chadwick Boseman had passed this movie had to honour him and his impact and did that flawlessly. Those who saw this movie either having not seen a previous Marvel movie with Black Panther in it could still understand the impact Chadwick Boseman had on those around him.

226,22 November 2022,hfreinoso,7," Honestly... Marvel/Disney should have recast T'Challa
","Black Panther Wakanda Forever was a movie I was hesitant to watch because, as many know, Chadwick Boseman has passed away from cancer, and it was hard to know that Kevin Feige was NOT going to recast the character and instead kill off T'Challa. And I have a massive problem with that because we have yet to explore the nature of T'Challa, and the story should have continued what Boseman started. And not kill the character just because the actor died. So Ryan Coogler had a tough job changing the new script and making a new story, and while I respect what he does and all the movies he writes and directs are exceptional; So I can expect to see, a movie with full 100% of heart that he cares. And of course, he does put his heart and soul. However, sadly, I am one of those people who wanted them to recast T'Challa than have him die in the universe. I wish they'd done this story as a show instead of a movie because there were so many elements that just didn't get enough time to be developed. Shuri simply has no agency for most of the film. We don't have time to see if she's mourning the loss of her brother, trying to deny the grief, struggling with the concept of having to someday lead her people or working through expectations put in place by her mother. We get little glimpses of these ideas, but not enough time to explore any of them. As a result, Shuri is just kinda ""there"" while the plot revolves around her, which sucks since she's the main character. I like how much more mature she is than in the first movie. She was better here and I did enjoy seeing her on a journey to find herself with her religious beliefs. Her questioning religion is a sight to see and needed more to explore. I did love Tenoch Huerta as Namor, he is brilliant as Namor, however, I still wish it was Atlantis and was their version of Atlantis that rivals Aquaman. Angela Bassett, I have nothing to say but she was the best part of this movie, and I did enjoy the performance she gave, but to me, she didn't need to die. I wanted her to continue the story of a struggle Queen. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne didn't work for me. I don't know what it is, but to me, I feel like we didn't need her, and she was nothing but a plot device for the movie and the story. And we don't even know why Wakanda wants to protect her if she is a random nobody, with just brains. Again, it's gotten so lazy to see someone with the gift of knowledge, but she is quite a one-dimensional character. Overall the movie is fine to me; I feel like if they kept the original story (Where T'Challa returns from the dead and he had to continue his journey as king and the story with him against Namor would have been miles better.) But again that's just me. 7/10. Still respect Ryan Coogler for what he did with this film.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

And then the rest happened. The film needed a stronger lead to follow throughout the film but how can you if you don't recast T'Challa? The film ultimately suffered from that absence but when you lose your star player the rest of the team generally suffers somewhat. Angela Bassett was great, probably the most impactful I've seen her in some time. Love Okoye in this one... She had the best action scene in the whole film. Shuri, Nakia, Umbaku, and Namor had their moments to shine but just like great role players they are not perfect stars but solid nonetheless. The outfit choices and some poor CGI, a long with a slog of a middle portion of the film is what dragged this down out of the top 10 MCU films for me.

Shuri is the star of this one, and Riri is a welcome addition to the MCU, but the story... whoever decided to make Atlanteans and Namor descended from Mesoamericans, did a poor job. Namor's mother wasn't human. As for the fear of using Atlantis, why? So what if DC used it as well? Why hasn't Marvel comics stopped losing it? And the actor playing Namor wasn't that convincing. He should have hit the gym a little more, and lost that goatee. The only time Namor had a beard was in the excellent Maestro series. They needed to put more thought into the origins of he and his people. Also was anyone surprised that the wristband fibers would enable Shuri to become the new Black Panther? I wasn't since it was telegraphed a mile away. I'm glad that Nakia and Winston Duke's characters survived. I was disappointed that there was no mid-credits scene, but perhaps there wasn't a reason yet. All in all, like all of phase 4, this was disappointing. It needed far better pacing. I will say Julia-Louis Drefuss plays a great villainous role. Kine of like Elaine Benes on crack. So, if I never see this again-like all of phase 4, I won't care.

","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a beautiful and poignant film about grief made by grieving people. I adored this film, not just for how well it honours and continues the legacy of the great Chadwick Boseman, but also how it truly felt like a natural progression from the first film. Ryan Coogler really had his work cut out for him with this film, and frankly was put in quite the impossible situation with the passing of Boseman. I am blown away at how skillfully he overcame these challenges and pivoted the story to a place that is obviously different from what we would all expect coming out of the first ""Black Panther"", and yet feels like a very natural and logical next step at the same time. Not only that, but this also feels like a return to form for the MCU after so long; this is the type of Marvel movie I fell in love with. Don't get me wrong, I have still liked (and in some cases, loved) most of Phase 4, but this film is easily the best Marvel has been since ""Endgame"". While my personal favourite of phase 4 still remains ""No Way Home"", this is a very close second to that. Films like ""Endgame"" and ""No Way Home"" were absolute triumphs, but Wakanda Forever is MCU's most beautiful, meaningful and soulful movie.

Don't get me wrong, the acting by Bassettt (Queen Ramonda) and Gurira (Okoye) were so good to watch. But the character development was lackluster and seemed to be the most genius person ever. She was more of a plot device and I wasn't sure why she was there at all.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv
263,1 December 2022,jdjj-80425,2," Nearly A Walk Out of the Theater Bad Sequel!
","Wakanda Forever had many gaps & was centered around the rituals for too long rather than using that time to better support the storyline itself. The 1st movie though had a good balance and the story was great! The decent acting performances in Wakanda Forever (in particular Namor, Ramonda, M'Baku and Okoye) were wasted by an incredibly poor script for the Riri character! I felt like the primary focus of the movie became lost as the movie progressed after a very slow and boring start which could have been forgiven if the storyline didn't continue to worsen. The 1st Black Panther movie was amazing, but Wakanda Forever was an utter disappointment! I'd regret watching this movie if it was completely free! I have never seen such a horrible Marvel film in my lifetime! The action scenes saved me from walking out of the theater! I'm judging this movie for what it is & not the unfortunate tragedy of the main character's before the sequel was filmed.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a beautiful film. It is attempting to be many things and it succeeds at being them for the most part. At once a superhero film, a sequel, a tribute, a comic adaptation and a chapter in the beloved MCU this film had the nearly impossible task of making a sequel to a cultural cornerstone of a movie and moving forward without that films lead. What we get in the end is a remarkable story about the inevitability of loss, but the onset of understanding that comes with grief and ultimately acceptance.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can not imagine the production struggles this film went through and they still presented a near perfect movie. I think Marvel giving Ryan Coogler the helm allowed this to be brought to the big screen the way it was meant to be. Such a solid tribute to Chad and the Balck Pamther character. Action sets that were awesome, and sets that were beautiful. Angela Bassett needs her Academy Award, she is a revelation. The other characters do play a significant part in the plot development as well. Denia Gurira also gives a fierce performance. The weight of the film lies on Letitia Wright's shoulders as we travel with her through her grieve and struggles she does an outstanding job balancing all these emotions. This was not my favorite Marvel movie but is up there for story development and emotional depth.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","The pacing of the movie wasn't good. Some of the scenes and plot moved way too slow. The villian story moved slowed and was boring. This movie was a tribute to chadwick bosman. A lot of sadness in a couple of scenes in the movie. Parts i didn't like is they shoehorned in riri williams. Honestly, she wasn't needed. It always bothers me that instead of focusing on the movie itself, its trying to introduce another character so that she can be on disney plus, which i don't care for at all. Also the lack of strong male figures in this movie bother me, the ones that are in it are comedy goofs. The cgi and some fight scenes were cool, the underwater cgi was not.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yes it's a little disjointed, but some known characters do show some depth and duality which can keep the viewer interested. But others seem out of place and unnatural. And still it successfully continues the story without having to rely on the multiverse. Which I'm so happy they didn't! Definitely safe for the kids and enjoyable for all. The effects are captivating and the story intersting. 95% of the acting is both believable and fit well into the marvel universe while paying respect to boseman. Several points left open to continue the story in interesting and welcome ways.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv

273,11 November 2022,jp_91,5," It fails to surprise.
","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a movie with a more mature theme than many others in the Marvel Universe, touching on the theme of emotional loss and overcoming it, although jokes and incompetent dialogue are also added that break that maturity narrative in a wrong way. The script draws on the history of Wakanda from an African perspective as seen before and adds the world of Namor with a Mexican perspective from its Mayan period, mixing mythology and futuristic fictional technology in a successful way. The evolution of Shuri's character is deep and the introduction of Namor's character is interesting, but the script is not exempt from being repetitive and making the film unnecessarily long. The CGI special effects feature elements that are well done and others that look quite fake. The editing work is very good and emphasizes the central theme already mentioned above, the loss of a loved one. The cinematography is excellent in the underwater scenes, but in the scenes above the water it becomes ordinary. Letitia Wright's performance is powerful, while Tenoch Huerta proves to be a good actor and Lupita Nyong'o fails to fully convince her character. A film with some remarkable technical elements, but a script that takes a good theme and overflows until it becomes tiresome.",/review/rw8670186/?ref_=tt_urv
